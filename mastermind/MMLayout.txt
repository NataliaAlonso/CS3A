CODER CLASS

User class gets CFG
Compares to code
Returns score [x,y]


GUESSER CLASS

Creates CFG
Submits CFG
Receives score [x,y]
Saves CFG and score in an array
Creates new CFG based on old CFG
	1. Randomly keeps x pegs
	2. Randomly moves y pegs
	3. Fills empty peg with random color
	4. EXCEPTION, if score was 0, remove colors from color pool, then create new guess
Submits guess
Receives score [x,y]
Converts score [x,y] to a score 0-13
Compare new score to old score
	1. Store guess and score
	2. If score is less than old score, then create new CFG based on old one
	3. If score is greater than or equal to old score, set CFG to guess
	4. Create new guess based on CFG
Compare new guess to previous guesses
	1. If guess is a previous guess, create new guess
	2. If guess is not a previous guess, submit
