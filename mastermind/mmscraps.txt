Algorithm
1. Submit a "random" guess called CFG (curent favorite guess) 
2. From the CFG, create new potential code
3. If code has already been used, repeat step 2.
4. If submitted guess score [0,0], suppress all colors from pool of colors. Repeat 2 with new pool of colors
5. If the guess score is as good or better than CFG, set as new CFG and update best score
6. If submitted score is [4,0], stop. Otherwise repeat step 2.

Generate a code
Enter a codebreaker
Compare codebreaker to code
Generate a score [x,y] where x is the number of correct pegs and y is the number of correct colors in the wrong place

Using score:
	If score is [0,0], suppress all colors in the code indefinitely.
	Take code breaker
	Randomly keep x pegs
	Randomly move y pegs
	IE. If 1234 has a score of [2,2], randomly keep "2" and "3", switch 4 and 1. Revaluate.
	Compare new codebreaker to previously used entries, discard and redo if already present.
	Submit new codebreaker and get score.
	Repeat
